This is a rewrite of the Mini Bachelor project application, refactored into Next.js with API routes. The original application is available [here](https://github.com/PavelSrom/minibachelor-frontend). The application is virtually identical to the original one, both functionality-wise and UI-wise.

## Features

- Built entirely using just a single framework - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Back-end functionality built using [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)
- End-to-end datamodel and database type safety with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- Simple server-side authentication using [Next-Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- Static typing with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Usage of Google's Material Design with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- Server state management with [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- Handling forms with [Formik](https://formik.org/) and [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup)
- Rapid UI building with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
